            <h2>Yoga</h2>
            <p>The word yoga literally means, “to connect”. For some it is a way to heal and connect to the body, to become healthy. For others a way to calm the mind, let go of stress and connect to the breath. A regular practice will help you to become aware and connect to the more subtle aspects of yourself. When these aspects become more integrated, you become more present in the moment and start aligning with your inner purpose.</p>

            <h2>Happiness</h2>
            <p>We all want to be happy. But often we look for it in the wrong places. We look for happiness outside of ourselves. We think of it as something to be obtained in the future. Or that we left it behind in the past. We think we will find it in achievements. In experiences. Possessions. This has shaped a society in constant pursuit for more and a world that spins faster and faster, under ever-increasing pressure and stress.

                Luckily, more and more people are discovering that real lasting happiness is found within. And when we find inner peace, it reflects outward – benefitting people around us and all aspects of our lives. At Delight Yoga we believe that yoga and meditation can lead to inner peace. And inner peace to world peace. This is why we do what we do.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>One lovely day in the summer of 2006, Wessel Paternotte founded Delight Studio on the Weteringschans in Amsterdam. It was a clean and beautiful space, inspired by Zen Buddhism, where he made authentic teachings accessible for a broader audience. While Wessel was teaching Reiki (healing), other teachers like Martijn Hoogstra (yoga), Tijn Touber (meditation), Juno Burger (space clearing) and later also Rob Brandsma (mindfulness) started to teach at Delight Studio.

                In 2008 Wessel met Kristin Skotnes Vikjord, a yogini from Bodø in northern Norway. It was love at first sight. A few months later, Kristin moved to Amsterdam and started to teach the first Astanga Yoga classes. Kristin’s classes became increasingly popular and the groups grew bigger. The schedule expanded quickly - and Chantal Soeters, Skadi van Paasschen and Daphne Luttger joined the team.

                In 2010, Katiza Satya was asked to be the guiding light on the path that was ahead. As spiritual director, she also started to shape the Delight Yoga teacher training. By this time, the school started blossoming. In fact, at times it became so crowded that another studio location started to become a necessity.

                It was in 2012 that Maarten van Huijstee joined Delight. Maarten had not only been meditating for more than a decade, but had also been successful building creative organizations. Not long after, the Delight Yoga studio on Nieuwe Achtergracht opened.

                In 2014, Claudia Pradella, student of Katiza Satya and founder of the Astanga Yoga School in Amsterdam, started to teach at Delight Yoga more often, eventually joining forces with Delight. Her students found a new home in our third studio on De Clercqstraat. Claudia became our Program Director and started to teach here on a daily basis.

                After many requests from yogis in The Hague, we went to take a look and instantly stumbled upon an old building, facing the Peace Palace. The symbolism of the place and its peaceful energy were clearly felt, and so a Delight Yoga studio was opened in The Hague in 2015.

                To be continued…

            <h2>The Inner Peace Conference</h2>
            <p>Delight Yoga is also the driving force behind The Inner Peace Conference. We choose to host this in Amsterdam because this city has continuously played its part on our collective ever-unfolding path of awakening. We invited some of the Worlds’most inspiring teachers, yogis, meditators, writers and musicians to practice inner peace together - and created a diverse program with talks and practices of all kinds in order to find Truth. See the after movie on the website of The Inner Peace Conference.</p>
